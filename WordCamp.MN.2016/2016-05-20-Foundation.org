** Never hack core

   Make your changes in ~wp-content/~.

** Hacking a theme

   - create a new theme directory in ~wp-content/themes/~

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       $ mkdir -p wp-content/themes/demo-theme
       $ cd wp-content/themes/demo-theme
     #+END_SRC

   - Make an empty style.css with just the theme name

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       echo '/* Theme Name: demo theme */' > style.css
     #+END_SRC

   - create a basic ~index.php~ file

     #+BEGIN_SRC php
       <?php

       echo 'this will work';
     #+END_SRC

   - create an empty ~functions.php~ file

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       $ touch functions.php
     #+END_SRC

   - Go back to the "Themes" section in the WP dashboard, and you
     should be able to select your new theme. When you view the site,
     all you should see is the string echoed from ~index.php~. Wollah!


** Typically start with something dervied from "Underscores" https://underscores.me

** Difference between child theme and starter theme:
   - Use a child theme to make style and function overrides of a parent theme
   - A starter theme is meant for you to change, will never be updated
     from source



*** child themes based on your starter theme?

    An interesting question was raised in the workshop about creating
    child themes from your starter-based theme for client
    delivery. The presenter seemed to poo-poo the idea but I think it
    actually has some merit. Even though you're doing work for a
    single client (bespoke) it makes sense to keep the parent-child
    theme on delivery because it will make the job of restructuring
    much easier down the road, and eliminate some of the effort of
    updating. Plus, you can reuse the same starter theme on other
    clients by only changing some of the details for similar
    functionality.

    This would not especially work well in the case of customer post
    types and that sort of thing, though.


* Beginning Templating / Structure Overview

** Files:
   - ~header.php~ -- all elements before the content
   - ~footer.php~ -- all elements after the content

*** splitting the layout

    I'm not altogether fond of the sort of layouts that are split in
    half. I think I much prefer the sort of layout system that yields
    the content passed to it. But this works.

** Functions:
   - ~get_header();~ includes the header.php content
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_header/

     #+BEGIN_SRC php
     get_header('home');
     #+END_SRC

     Retrieves the file ~header-home.php~.

   - ~get_footer();~ includes the footer.php content
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_footer/
   - ~get_sidebar();~
   - ~have_posts();~ returns number of posts remaining in the loop,
     counting down to zero
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/have_posts/
   - ~the_post();~ iterate the post index in The Loop. Retrieves the
     next post, sets up the post, sets the 'in the loop' property to
     true.
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_post/
   - ~the_title();~ writes the title from the post into the page
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_title/
   - ~the_permalink();~
   - ~the_content();~
   - ~the_date();~, ~the_time();~ Date and time of post, resp.
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_date/
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_time/

** The Loop

   https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop

   Used to control the display of posts. The central concept in
   wordpress.

** Getting good test data

   http://wptest.io/
   A good suite of test data when developing

* Templating continued - required actions / functions / enqueuing

** parts
   - get_tempate_part( string $slug , string $name );
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_template_part/

** actions
   - ~wp_head();~ -- put this inside the ~header.php~ file, just
     before the closing ~</head>~ tag.
     https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/wp_head
   - ~wp_footer();~ -- put this inside the ~footer.php~ file, just
     before the closing ~</body>~ tag.
     https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/wp_footer
   - ~wp_enqueue_script();~ -- generally goes in ~functions.php~ but
     you can use it in included component items as well.
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/
   - ~wp_enqueue_style();~ (for style sheets) -- similar to the above.
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/
   - ~add_action()~ -- needed to actually enqueue scripts and styles
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_action/

** hooks
   - ~wp_enqueue_scripts~ -- this is the hook name used in
     ~add_action~. It determines the timing (or sequencing more
     accurately) of when the scripts/styles should be emitted from the
     queue.

** putting it together:

   In ~functions.php~:

   #+BEGIN_SRC php

     /**
      ,* This is the way to get your custom theme's styles onto the page.
      ,*/

     function demo_theme_name_scripts() {
         wp_enqueue_style( 'demo-style', get_stylesheet_uri() );
         // no JS at this point, but if you had some, this is how it would be done
         //wp_enqueue_script( 'demo-script', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/example.js', array(), '1.0.0', true );
     }
     add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'demo_theme_name_scripts' );

   #+END_SRC

* Custom Post Types, Custom Fields

** custom taxonomies

   - Installing custom post taxonomies need to happen at ~init~ hook time.
   - ~register_post_type();~
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/
   - ~register_taxonomy();~
     https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_taxonomy/

** NOTE!! Difference between actions and filters

   - Actions do something, but don't return anything.
   - Filters do something, and return a string.
   - Example:

     - Action:

       #+BEGIN_SRC php
       <?php the_title("<h1>", "</h1>"); ?>
       #+END_SRC

     - Filter:

       #+BEGIN_SRC php
       <?php echo "<h1>" . get_the_title() . "</h1"; ?>
       #+END_SRC

     These effectively do the same thing.

     If you tried the following, however, the title would be emitted
     before the header tags:

     #+BEGIN_SRC php
     <?php echo "<h1>" . the_title() . "</h1>"; ?>
     #+END_SRC

     This would work:

     #+BEGIN_SRC php
     <h1><?php the_title(); ?></h1>
     #+END_SRC

     And here we have PHP's TMTOWTDI in a nutshell: at least one of
     the ways you think it's going to work, isn't.


** naming for custom post types needs to match

   e.g.: ~archive-employees.php~ for new post type ~employees~.

   The plurality of the new post type needs to match here. If you're
   new post type is ~employee~, then the archive page needs to be
   ~archive-employee.php~ as well.

   There is also a ~single-employee.php~ you can add to display a
   single employee post type.

   https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Post_Type_Templates

** generate custom post types and taxonomies

   https://generatewp.com/

   Fill out the form fields identifying your new post type / taxonomy,
   copy and paste the snippet.

   Generators yay!!

* Intro to WP Query()

** create a new WP_Query object
   Happens behind the scenes with query_posts() and get_posts().
   https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query

** modify a query before it runs

   - ~pre_get_posts~ , use to re-order the posts, for example

** Custom Field Plugin
   https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2
   http://hasinhayder.github.io/cmb2-metabox-generator/

** Using WP_Query directly

   The example given was in creating the archive page for employees,
   and creating a set of helper functions to run ~WP_Query~ in a
   number of situations.

* Advanced Topics / General Help

  No time for this...

* Notes about my own installation / experiments

** Started with a vagrant box running apache2

   Ran into problems getting the ~.htaccess~ file written by Wordpress
   to work.

   Gave up and switched to nginx. (as you do.)

** Configuring redirect:

   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
     location /blog/ {
       try_files $uri $uri/ /blog/index.php?$args ;
     }
   #+END_SRC

   p.much just works

** NOTE: when using nginx onna vagrant steek

   Set ~sendfile: off;~ in ~/etc/nginx/nginx.conf~!!

   This is due to the poor and sometimes non-existent signaling of
   file system change events. The nginx server doesn't get wind of the
   change, and so sends a cached version. ~sendfile: off~ turns off
   the caching.

** wp-cli

   http://wp-cli.org/

   command line tool to work with wordpress.

   useful with wptest to actually import stuff, if things about user
   and file permissions didn't necessitate another level of
   indirection.

** thoughts about file ownership

   The default web server runs under the user/group
   ~www-data:www-data~. It seems to make things a lot easier to change
   that to run under ~vagrant:vagrant~ so you can run things without
   constantly dropping into superuser.

   As it's just the vagrant box, it should matter all that much from a
   security standpoint.

   Public deployments shouldn't do this.

** thoughts about project structure

   I ended up provisioning the wordpress install under
   ~/var/www/html/blog/~ with modifications to the nginx site
   configuration.

   For custom theme development:
   - I made a directory under ~/vagrant~ for themes,
   - *copied* over the installation default themes from
     ~wp-content/themes/~,
   - created a new directory ~/vagrant/wp_themes/demo~ for the new
     theme hacking,
   - *symlinked* the demo theme folder back under
     ~wp-content/themes/demo~
   - working in ~/vagrant/wp_themes/demo~ lets me keep it under a
     different Git repo and edit files on the host machine.
